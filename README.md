# --------Objective---------

To create and build a responsive ecommerce issue tracking website that allows users to create tickets, comment on tickets, and show the status of the ticket. And also add features if they need the bugs to be fix in a certain timeframe which will come at a charge depending on the scale of the project.

# ----Project’s Core Functionality-----

• Solid Structure and architecture The whole website was built and designed around data and the user experience. To attractive users with stylish website, get them to sign up with robust backend code and the using a very well structure framework, output the members recipes and feedback to the wider audience. I have proven to show proper structure and solid architect design to achieve this.

• Great UX & UI The projects main design goal is to make the experience and navigation look effortless through each page and create a pleasant feel for the user on a smart phone and desktop. A critical factor was to make the website very responsive for mobile and desktop.

• Persuasion To persuade the user to register and login which will start the users journey through the website. This will be achieved with marketing techniques on the website so there first experience will be enjoyable and increase the chances of them returning again.

• Data centric Design To demonstrate to the user that this issuer tracker website is a great fit going forward if any bugs and features that arise on their business website and also a place where they can get great advice on improving their data performance.

• A stunning visual website To show off to the user with stunning design features on the website and incredible images to enhance their perception about our service. To do this i have incorporating stunning css and bootstrap elements to each page and brought the pages to light by minimising some section and stretching others to great that amazing effect of design within each page.

• Attention to detail There was a lot of attention to detail gone into making this website a success for both the backend and frontend. I put in more code into the frontend to make sure that the website looked incredible on mobile. While also creating a solid and robust authentication process and database to make the standards i set in the front-end of the website.

• Solid core features to promote I made sure to entice users to request features on the website by using effective marketing techniques to promote our main features that earn the most profits.

# --------Technologies Used------------

• Html5

• css

• javascript

• bootstrap

• flexbox

• Chrome and Firefox developer tools

• Stripe

• PostgresSQL

• visual studio code

• jquery

• photoshop

• cssgradient.io

• django

• Whitenoise

• python

• MySQL


# ---------Testing----------

• Apart from doing python and javascript testing to make sure everything was above board, 40% of the testing took part in Chrome and Microsoft Explorer developer tools to test the responsiveness of the website. The reason being is that there is no point promoting and selling your service if the website in the front-end is not a high standard.

• In terms of the backend coding i really had to take a bird eye view of the structure of my code and syntax to really get a grip of how i was going to make this code execute. For that reason i took each block of code, tested it on visual studio code and if it did not execute, i would then have to understand the fundamentals better by reading more python documentation on websites like w3schools and tutorials point. I found this effective technique as i wasn’t trying to code by way out of the problems but planning and understand the core concepts better after making mistakes.

# ---------User Experience-----------


• To achieve the primary goals and functions

As mention above the main functions of the website were

• Solid Structure and architecture

• Persuasion

• Data centric Design

• A stunning visual website

• Attention to detail

• Solid core features to promote

So the user experience was based on these factors and every decision was built around whether it improved these three functions or not.

• A user-friendly website-app In order to persuade the user to add a bug or feature the overall ease and design of the website had to be at a high standard. The navigation between pages had to be simple and effective, which i have achieved through proper planning and testing which was done on the wireframe.

• Marketing behavioural psychology i Incorporated different design, images, fonts and words to get the user to feel a certain way to increase the chance of them taking actions and coming back to the website for a second visit..

• Show stopping website design the website must be professional, show character and a have show topping design features via images or css to make the user browse more around the website and stay on that website a little longer . Promoting the services

The content be that the text or images depicting the services provided had to be easily understood and aesthetically pleasing to the eye to have any chance of the user signing up, which i have achieved with this website. Wireframe diagram I have provide a very simple wireframe to understand for this website that highlights the importance that each section of the website had, be it albums, tours, merchandise and about the band.



# --------User Interface----------

• My goal as the user interface developer was to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible which i think i have achive through user-centered design.

• I provided a well Guided behaviour navigation through the website with design patterns, and a clear, but simple hierarchy and readability for the user.

• The Key sections of the website(tour, about, albums and merchandise) are very eye catching to increase the user’s attention

• I provided a well thought out design a next step for each user interaction a person has with your interface of the website. I show familiarity in terms of what the user is going to anticipate what the next interaction should be and design to support it.

• The aesthetic quality of the website will enhance the user ui and ux of the website. Therefore increasing the likelihood of a interaction via email or sales on the website.

# ----------Project Deployment------------

• VS Code

Deploying it locally on VS code was very straightforward.(py \Users\User\Desktop\django_project_issuetracker\djangoproject-copy\manage.py runserver)

To make migrations was similar to above code. (py \Users\User\Desktop\django_project_issuetracker\djangoproject-copy\manage.py makemigrations)  , then (py \Users\User\Desktop\django_project_issuetracker\djangoproject-copy\manage.py migrate)

• Heroku

When testing whether the app runs i would find it a lot easier to spot error when deploying it manually from github, as automatic deployement does not show much when you view it in the logs. It was harder than i taught to deploy the app successfully on heroku and getting good practice and experience from do it in this project, i can identify beforehand the common errors and laser focus i need to deploy another one in the future

• System Variables

Without proper planning in terms of system variables the app can be much harder to run and spot any errors which i encounter with leaving out a few pieces of code. Its the back bone of getting the app to deploy properly and something that i will pay more attention to it to avoid mistakes in the future.

• gitignore

Using gitignore was very straightforward and is used to hide key pieces of secret information by combining it with settings.py and env.py and then therefore telling gitignore to hide env.py in github.

• Procfile

I had issues with the procfile, i created using powershell terminal and because that there was a space in the file, which did not read the code when running on Heroku. So after testing in different terminals it worked on bash, which fix the problem.

• Config Vars

Working with config vars in heroku was very simple to use containg the postgresql key and value which was then inserting in my env.py file.
